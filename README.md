# Compiler_Simulation

### This repository contains programming assignments for compiler simulation that were completed during the tenth semester. Each assignment was done individually using Java.

## Task3:
    In this task, I implemented a fallback deterministic finite automaton-with-actions (FDFA) abstract data type.
## Task4:
    In this task, I implemented the algorithms for eliminating-epsilon-and-unit-rules from a given context-free grammar (CFG).
## Task5:
    In this task, I implemented the left-recursion-elimination algorithm for a given context-free grammar (CFG).
## Task6:
   In this task, I implemented algorithms for computing the First and Follow functions for the variables of a given context-free grammar (CFG).
## Task7: 
   In this task, I implemented an LL(1) parser using a pushdown-automata (PDA) and predictive parsing tables.
